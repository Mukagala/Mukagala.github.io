I decided to study software engineering because I wanted to change my careers as well as fill up the gap that has been created due to not so many software engineers in the market. I also wantd an experience to say my work at the end of a programming session. Being able to work with brilliant minds and also being able to learn from them. To have that financial freedom while enjoying what I am doing.
